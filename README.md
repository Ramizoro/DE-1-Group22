In this project we take the dataset Webis-TLDR-17 Corpus from https://zenodo.org/records/1043504#.Wzt7PbhXryo which was originally created by Syed, S. Et al.[1]. The dataset consists of 3,848,330 posts with an average length of 270 words for content, and 28 words which we use to analyze and create a list of trending topic based on how frequently they are mentioned. We also a develop a horizontally scalable data processing solution for this project.
